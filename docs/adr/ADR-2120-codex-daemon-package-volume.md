# ADR-2120 — Give Codex daemon packages executable persistent storage

## Re-verification — 2026-10-02 at caab741c6 (factrail landing, ADR-2121)

The factrail landing (ADR-2121, `b7fc2b0e5` + `caab741c6`) touched governed paths without touching this decision: `config/entrypoint-unified.sh` changes only inside the compaction section (install/uninstall factrail, store migration, key projection); `flake.nix` gains only the factrail package, its `/opt/agentbox/bin/factrail` link and the shim copy, each under `lib.optionalString jevCompactionOn`. No hunk falls in code this record governs, so its claims and status axes stand unchanged.

## Context

Codex 0.158.0 stages daemon packages in `CODEX_HOME/packages`. Agentbox mounts
CODEX_HOME on a 512 MiB noexec tmpfs. A local execution probe failed with EACCES,
and Codex doctor reported insufficient package storage. `--no-daemon` bypassed
this path; `--yolo` remains a separate approval/sandbox option.

## Decision

Mount a disk-backed named volume, `agentbox-codex-packages`, at
`/home/devuser/.codex/packages`. Initialise its root ownership to UID/GID 1000
at boot. Retain the parent's bounded noexec configuration tmpfs.

Refresh generated Compose through `scripts/refresh-compose.sh` before local
builds, including `up --build` and the rebuild flow. Validate the generated file
before atomically replacing the existing configuration. Failed generation or
validation preserves the existing file. This closes the deployment gap where
an image rebuild retained stale mounts.

## Verification and activation

Nix generated Compose successfully in a disposable builder using a copied
source snapshot. Four tests passed: resolved persistent mount identities,
successful refresh, failed Nix generation and failed Compose validation.
Shell syntax and diff whitespace checks pass. A disposable Docker test
confirmed that the parent blocks execution while the nested package volume
allows execution and accepts UID 1000 ownership.

Image `sha256:399888769570` is live. The resolved Compose model and live mounts
agree on `agentbox-codex-packages`; all 18 named-volume identities match and the
original workspace volume is retained. A real `codex app-server daemon start`
installed the 0.158.0 managed binary into the new volume, reported the daemon
running, and stopped cleanly. The stored package occupies 351 MiB and survives
the bounded parent tmpfs.

`codex doctor` still judges free space from the parent `CODEX_HOME` mount and
therefore reports its 512 MiB limit even though the executable package subtree
is a separate 59 GiB disk-backed mount. The real install/start test proves the
original EACCES/storage failure is closed; the remaining doctor result is an
upstream nested-mount accounting limitation, not a runtime failure.

ADR index regeneration remains blocked by seven existing stale verification
anchors in other records; those anchors were not rewritten.

Tripped by ADR-2078 (pods signer signs as the sovereign identity). `config/entrypoint-unified.sh` changes only in Phase 3: an `AGENTBOX_IDENTITY_ROOT` default export before `nostr-pod-bridge bootstrap`, and a chown to devuser plus chmod 0600 of the bootstrap identity file after it (ADR-2078). It touches no section, key or phase this record governs, and the decision holds unchanged.
Re-verified by `git diff c7b5d5f55..a48ea407a -- <verified_paths>`; no re-implementation was needed.

Tripped by the `sidestr:dreamlab-txbt4` seal. `flake.nix` adds `sidechainChains`, one entry per `[sidechain.<name>]` table. For each table enabled under an enabled `[sidechain]` it bakes three supervisor programs, `sidestr-{producer,mirror,faucet}-<name>`: user devuser, the existing `config/sidechain` runners, and a producer the engine binds to 127.0.0.1:3451. `sidestr-agent` is baked when any faucet is on. The one table shipped is `enabled = false`, so the rendered supervisor text is unchanged. No port, Compose service, volume, user, MCP registration or other program moved. No volume or Codex package path changed. **Decision unaffected.** `verified_commit` moves to the seal commit. Gates at that commit:

- the manifest validator is valid;
- `check-manifest-catalogue` passes;
- `tests/config/sidechain-genesis.test.sh` passes 7/7 and `sidechain-producer-gates.test.sh` 7/7.

## Re-verification — 2026-10-03 (`055c06ff69b2f53bf38a67d254c048bb03599fc8`)

Tripped by custody X-1 step 1 (W0 `custody/w0-bypasses` and W1 `custody/w1-role-accounts`). `flake.nix` changed only as follows. W0 (`8070c1010`, `6a433e6b3`): `root` loses its `devuser` member, and `[program:docker-read-proxy]` is added (root start, drops to 65534). W1 (`b8c66625a`, `055c06ff6`): role passwd and group lines are appended from `config/role-accounts.json`, `supervisord.roles.conf`, `role-secrets.tsv` and `role-accounts.json` are derived beside the unchanged `supervisord.conf`, and a root-owned `/run/secrets` tmpfs is added (ADR-2122). `config/entrypoint-unified.sh` changed only as follows. W0: the root boot `PATH` is store-only, the workspace cargo bin is appended for devuser shells only, Stage B is one-shot and the Docker socket is gated. W1: the role-custody lib is sourced, and the `/run/secrets` and supervisor-config steps are gated on `[security].role_isolation`; flag-off statements are verbatim (ADR-2122). `docker-compose.yml` gains one tmpfs line. The Codex package volume and its exec mount are untouched. The decision holds.
Re-verified by `git diff 0919dc39a..055c06ff6 -- <verified_paths>`. No re-implementation was needed. The image is unverified until the owner's rebuild.

## Re-verification — 2026-10-03 (`275e12356319a9630846656580d497d53de3d38c`)

Tripped by custody X-1 step 1, W2 (`custody/w2-env-scrub`: `0965a9c8c`, `042115499`, `275e12356`; bypass 3, ROLE secrets out of PID 1's environment). `config/entrypoint-unified.sh` gains the W2 role-env block (`_AB_ROLE_ENV_VARS`, `_ab_role_env_capture` before the identity bootstrap, `_ab_role_env_scrub` on the line before `exec supervisord`, `_ab_role_key_file_own` in Phase 5c). Every function returns at its first line unless `[security].role_isolation` is on, so the flag-off boot is unchanged (RC-X1-06 compares the environment handed to supervisord byte for byte). `flake.nix` changes only `[program:tailscale-up]` (a `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY_FILE` branch that passes `--authkey=file:<path>`; the original branch is unchanged and is the one taken with the flag off) and the `[program:nostr-gateway]` comment. The decision holds.
Re-verified by `git diff 055c06ff6..275e12356 -- <verified_paths>`. No re-implementation was needed. The image is unverified until the owner's rebuild.

## Re-verification — 2026-10-03 (`3b54129631067277f6363309b01cce485faa027a`, custody integration head)

Tripped by the custody integration (`custody/integration`: W0, W1, W5, W3, W7a, W8, W2, W9 and
the integration resolutions, ADR-2122). Since `275e12356` the governed paths changed as follows. `agentbox.sh` gains W9's `browsercontainer_fetch_podkey` before sidecar builds and a `browsercontainer podkey` subcommand (`7c10e502b`); nothing outside the browsercontainer verbs changes. `config/entrypoint-unified.sh` changed in a comment and a log line (the config's new name, `760ed01e4`). W2's role-env capture now runs `mkdir -p` on the secrets root and `mkdir -m 0700` on the role dir (`3b5412963`). That fixes shellcheck SC2174 and behaves the same. Both changes are reached only with the flag on. `flake.nix` gains three things: W5's read-only bake of the sidestr upstream (`lib/sidestr-upstream.nix`, linked at `/opt/agentbox/sidestr/upstream` under `[sidechain].enabled`; `e103f81a7`); the isolated supervisor config renamed `/etc/supervisord.roles.conf` (`760ed01e4`); and a `[program:serve-identity]` block that prints one line and exits 0 while `[security].role_isolation` is off (`b49c62249`).
The Codex package volume is untouched. The decision holds. Re-verified by `git log 275e12356..3b5412963 -- <verified_paths>`
and the integration gates. Nix was not evaluated in this container; the image is unverified
until the owner's rebuild.

## Re-verification — 2026-10-03 (`32cedf9925ff6de8112fb45e41de048106d0d710`, custody integration CI fix)

Tripped by `32cedf992`, the fix for the PR's clippy and statix failures. `flake.nix` changes by one line in the `[sidechain.*]` normaliser: `parent = c.parent;` becomes `inherit (c) parent;` (statix W04), which evaluates to the same attribute set. Nothing this record governs changes meaning. The decision holds. Re-verified by `git log 3b5412963..32cedf992 -- <verified_paths>`.

## Re-verification — 2026-10-03 (`dc91e092ab646b4a825805b8229602ac8b15bad3`, custody W10)

Tripped by the W10 gap fixes on `custody/integration`. `config/entrypoint-unified.sh` (`dc91e092a`) gains `_ab_devuser_privilege_check` and its call after the docker-socket check; it reads files only and is a no-op with `[security].role_isolation` off; `flake.nix` (`dc91e092a`) gains one let-binding, `roleIsolationBaked = securityCfg.role_isolation or false`, and its inline `/etc/sudoers` lines become a call to `config/bake-devuser-privilege.sh` with that flag; with the flag off (the shipped value) the baked `/etc/group`, `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/devuser` are byte-identical (RC-X1-07). Nothing this record governs changes meaning. The decision holds. Re-verified by `git log 32cedf992..dc91e092a -- <verified_paths>`. Nix was not evaluated in this container.

## Re-verification — 2026-10-03 (`f93586b9e52fda0d0b367881e2d2ff3014509faf`, custody W2b/W4)

Tripped by `f93586b9e` (custody W2b and W4: the at-rest migrate/revert and the sidechain state move). `config/entrypoint-unified.sh` changes only in three custody blocks (ADR-2122, design 3.2). (1) A new at-rest step before Phase 3: `ab_custody_migrate` when `[security].role_isolation` is on, otherwise `ab_custody_revert`, which changes nothing on a volume that was never migrated (`tests/config/role-custody-migrate.test.sh` shows the stat set, ctime included, byte-identical). (2) Under the flag only, the volume-root chown loop skips `/var/lib/agentbox/secrets`. (3) After the identity bootstrap, the identity file goes to ab-identity 0400 under the flag; with the flag off, the devuser 0600 statements are unchanged. The Codex package volume and its exec mount are untouched. The decision holds. Re-verified by `git log dc91e092a..f93586b9e -- <verified_paths>`.

### Re-verification — 2026-10-03 (vaultSrc repin)

`f93586b9e..33cbb29e8` changes one governed line: `flake.nix` `vaultSrc` moves from VisionClaw `64512141b` to main `94dc0ff60` (`33cbb29e8`, PR #13; ADR-2108 records why). Its one consumer is `lib/vault.nix` (the vault CLI package, `flake.nix:781`); nothing this record governs (ADR-2120 — Give Codex daemon packages executable persistent storage) reads it. The decision holds. Re-verified by `git log f93586b9e..33cbb29e8 -- <verified_paths>`.

### Re-verification — 2026-10-03 (poker house seat, PR #14)

`33cbb29e8..b41d9486c`: `flake.nix` bakes `nostr-bbs-poker-citizen` (`lib/poker-citizen.nix`) and a `[program:poker-citizen]` (`user=devuser`) only when `[sidechain].enabled` and `[poker_citizen].enabled`; it opens no listener: it dials the forum relay over `wss` and the local producer at `127.0.0.1:3450` (`55b9fe9f6`). Nothing this record governs (ADR-2120 — Give Codex daemon packages executable persistent storage) reads the new table or program. The decision holds. Re-verified by `git log 33cbb29e8..b41d9486c -- <verified_paths>`.
